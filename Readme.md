# H2-Database-Sample

H2 is an open-source lightweight relational database for the Java platform. It is provided by Spring Boot by default and is easy and quick to set up in comparison with other databases. Using H2 as a database in training projects can help you to concentrate on learning Spring Boot and java features instead of database-specific setup.
